## 📖 Usage Guide

### Studying Data Structures & Algorithms
1. Start with basic data structures in each category
2. Progress to more complex algorithms
3. Use the video resources for visual learning
4. Practice with platform-specific problems
5. Review GitHub implementations for reference

Example:
```javascript
// To explore graph algorithms:
import dsaData from './data/dsaData';

// Access specific algorithms
const dfsResources = dsaData.Graph.dfs;
const bfsResources = dsaData.Graph.bfs;

// Get video tutorials
const dfsVideo = dfsResources['DFS Traversal'].youtube;
```

### Learning System Design
1. Begin with fundamentals of each category
2. Understand how components interact
3. Study real-world examples and case studies

Example:
```javascript
// To explore scalability concepts:
import hldData from './data/hldData';

// Access specific topics
const loadBalancing = hldData['Scalability & Performance']['Load Balancing'];
```

### Implementing Design Patterns
1. Study the pattern definition and use cases
2. Review code examples
3. Adapt patterns to your own projects

Example:
```javascript
// To explore design patterns:
import lldData from './data/lldData';

// Access specific patterns
const singletonPattern = lldData['Design Patterns']['Creational Patterns']['Singleton'];
```

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions to expand our learning resources!

### Adding New Algorithms
1. Create a new implementation file in the appropriate directory
2. Follow the established format:
```javascript
const newAlgorithm = {
  "Algorithm Name": {
    youtube: "https://youtu.be/example",
    platform: "LeetCode",
    github: "https://github.com/example",
  },
};

export default newAlgorithm;
```
3. Update the corresponding category file
4. Ensure proper JSDoc documentation

### Adding Design Patterns
1. Add the pattern to the appropriate category
2. Include clear examples and use cases
3. Provide resources for further learning

### Adding Coding Examples
1. Create implementation files with clear, commented code
2. Include usage examples
3. Add references to external resources

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
